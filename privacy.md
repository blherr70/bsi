## What Information Does This Site Collect?  
<br>  
### Newsletter or Blog:
If you voluntarily sign up for {{ site.title }} {{ site.ext }}’s newsletter or blog, this site will record your **email address and first name**. You can refuse to supply personal information, but that will exclude you from certain related activities such as receiving newsletters, blogs, and free offers. When subscribers click on a link in one of my emails or fills out a form, the site may record this information (see below how this information is used).

Subscribers may unsubscribe at any time. You may ask for all your data to be deleted at any time.

#### Giveaways and Contests:
If you enter a giveaway, your **email address** is collected. If you win a physical prize, you will be asked to give your name and physical address.

#### Non-personal Information
This website may collect non-personal information about visitors when they interact with the site. This information may include the browser name, means of connection to the site, and other non-identifying information.

#### Cookies
This website may use “cookies” to enhance visitor experience. Typically, cookies may be placed on visitors’ hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. Visitors may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to send an alert when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the site may not function properly.

### How Is the Information Used?
Newsletter and blog subscribers’ names and emails will only be used for receiving the newsletters, the blog, or communication from {{ site.title}} {{ site.ext }}.

Giveaway entrants will be sent emails only about the giveaway, unless they also signed up for the newsletter or blog.

Information on which email links are clicked on the most will help Your Name choose links that interest readers in future emails.

{{ site.title}} {{ site.ext }} may use affiliate codes in some of the emails or on the site. <!-- (Note: you may need to specify more on this depending on what certain affiliate programs require.) -->

### Sharing of Personal Information
Subscriber information is never shared with an third party. The only exception is that email addresses may occasionally be used to create lookalike audiences for online marketing. This in no way distributes the emails or signs subscribers up to any other services.

### Third-party links
Sometimes {{ site.title}} {{ site.ext }} will include third-party links through email or on the website. These sites have their own policies and you should read those before subscribing or purchasing from them.

### Security of Information
All information is saved by {{ site.url }} and only {{ site.title}} can access them. Should a data breach ever occur, subscribers will be notified within 7 days.

### Questions?
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or anything else on {{ site.url }}, please email {{ site.title }} at {{ site.email }}.
